## Agenda and Notes

### Group activity at FORCE2021

We have received the following invitation - what, if anything, should we do?

> As you’re probably aware, the FORCE2021 conference (https://www.force11.org/meetings/force2021) will be held virtually December 7-9, 2021. The program committee is currently organizing several keynotes and panel discussions. In addition, there is a current call for proposals for lightning talks and posters. The format/timeslots of the event are set up to accommodate time zones around the world.
> 
> I am writing to invite and encourage your working group to participate in the conference. This could take many different shapes I need to outline some options:
> 
> * Pre-meetings: in the days and weeks leading up to the conference, several groups are organizing pre-meeting discussions.  So far, several groups are planning 1-4 hour sessions in the weeks leading up to the conference discussing various topics.  If your working group is interested in a dedicated day or time in the run up to the conference, one option could be for your working group to organize this type of event.
> * Lightning talks and poster sessions: if members of your working group would like to discuss your topics during the conference there are slots for lighting talks and poster sessions. Please feel free to propose as many of them as make sense through our FORCE2021 call for proposals form by October 15.
> * Birds of a Feather: There will be several time blocks for birds of a feather sessions. This will be conducted on a virtual environment where attendees can walk around and go into rooms discussing several topics. Your working group is encouraged to host a table/room to discuss your work in one or all of the sessions.
> * Dedicated WG Session. There are several time blocks in the calendar throughout the three days to accommodate a one hour zoom host a webinar. If you’re working group is interested in doing this, we can promote the session and set up the zoom account. The format and approach for the one hours would be completely up to you were working group to customize.
>
> I know there are a lot of options here to consider. If you are interested in one or more of these options, please let us know. I can get you in contact with the conference organizers and make sure your working group has the resources needed to organize and promote your activities at FORCE2021. 

From last month:
> There was agreement in the call that we should schedule a hackathon, two half days before and after the main conference (so December 6 and 10). There is interest to together not only work on code, but also other joint activities. Martin will coordinate planning. For the conference itself, there is little time to talk about topics relevant for the Software Citation Implementation WG.

From Morane via email:
> Please let me know if you need my contribution to the FORCE2021 activities by email.
> I can lead activities regarding CodeMeta, such as crosswalking, documenting or improving the CodeMeta generator: https://codemeta.github.io/codemeta-generator/
