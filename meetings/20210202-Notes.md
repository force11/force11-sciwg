## Agenda and Notes

### Updates from Task Forces

#### Journals Task Force (Dan/Shelley)

- [Notes from last call](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-8uFuCLBG8fw6RlJ6imkEsue4kWBkBMKMUOY59s4R0g/edit)
- Task force has two threads: publicity and practices, and publisher workflow
- Publicity and Practices:
  - [revised version of journal guidance](https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.26932.2) published
    - [Scholarly Kitchen blog post](https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2021/01/21/guest-post-citing-software-in-scholarly-publishing-to-improve-reproducibility-reuse-and-credit/) published - second hand info that it's been discussed by other publishers as well, e.g. ACM
    - [F1000R blog/PR](https://blog.f1000.com/2021/01/26/guidance-on-software-citation-created-by-the-community-for-the-community/) posted
    - Aim is to get people to sign up to implementing the practices
    - NISO Plus 2021 talks recorded, which include discussion about this task force and its progress
- Publisher Workflow:
  - Taking forward data citation and software citation together with publishers as the issues are similar
  - High level document for production staff to get common approachers to how deal with citations
  - Aiming to disseminate this at the NISO meeting
  - Align with CrossRef schema update
- Publishers focus on DOIs - how might we get better support for other PIDs? Trying to make sure that others don't get obliterated.
  - SWH working with IPOL to better embed SWHIDs: [an example](https://doi.org/10.5201/ipol.2020.300)
  - SWH and eLife talk at PIDapalooza 2021
  - Question raised based on this example about whether an indexer would understand that software was an element as part of this metadata
  - Is more work with different indexers also needed, eg Scopus, DCI
  - Suggests potential need for a task force / discussion / workshop on indexing (see later notes)

#### Repositories Task Force (Alice)

- Report from the Task Force published: [Nine Best Practices for Research Software Registries and Repositories: A Concise Guide](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13117)
  - Next step is implementation by repositories and registries and evaluating whether this document changes practice
- Workshop results
  - Caltech submitted final report to Sloan for workshop funding
  - Workshop report drafted, but not quite final
- Task force is wrapping up
- Additionally, this month the task force (Alice, Mike, and Tom) will set up a larger semi-formal group (community of practice) so we can collaborate where we can and share ideas for better managing/improving our resources. Mike Hucka has set up a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/SciCodes) for this effort, and weâ€™ll also likely repurpose scicodes.net for it.
  - This group will be called SciCodes and will regularly communicate with the FORCE11 Software Citation Implementation working group.

#### CodeMeta task force (Martin/Morane)

- [Notes from last call](https://github.com/force11/force11-sciwg/blob/master/meetings/20210120-codemeta.md)
- Next call will be debating some of the different properties
- CodeMeta now at version 2.0 - looking to get modifications into version 3.0
- There is very limited awareness and usage of CodeMeta - the task force is considering a workshop or some other publicity around CodeMeta
  - perhaps with the 2021 FORCE11 conference, if there is one in the fall, either virtual or hybrid
  - Alice reported very a low response to her requests for software packages in ASCL to add CodeMeta or CFF files (4 successes out of 135 requests), though 52 had some suggestion of how to cite the software
  - Morane suggested that perhaps these packages are not being developed there, and that they are just archived at this point
  - Neil suggested some activity to analyse and react to this
  - Alice reports other repositories are also using CodeMeta
- Some of the Google team who support schema.org have reached out around software citation

### Plans for WG in 2021 (from last month's call)

- General publicity/community building?
- Broad discussion on what the next steps for the SCI-WG are

  - Feeling is that there are still specific goals to be accomplished e.g. in the Journals Task Force
  - A possibility is to use the SCI-WG as a "steering group" to help identify things we should be helping coordinate which are not related to the current task forces, e.g. FAIR4RS, software metrics, approaches to identifying software papers
  - Rather than having guest presentation at the monthly calls, there may be some areas where we want more regular engagement to build a longer, larger community
  - This might mean we should consider if the group needs to rescope slightly
  - New FORCE11 Board has been elected - co-chairs could talk with the board to see if they're happy with the current governance, scope and activities

- A specific suggestion was raised around indexing, including:
  - How indexers identify, ingest and use software references and metadata
  - How identifiers for specific software might be better federated or linked between different discipline specific representations / identifier implementations.
    - An example would be how a generic piece of software like Pandas was represented. Wikidata might be a technical approach to solving this, but is this the right time to start addressing this issue?
    - In the libraries community a similar problem exists for federating library catalogues - there is the concept of "authority control" and an example is the OCLC.
    - We need to do some scoping about what the right scope, goals and makeup of an indexing task force (who are the right players?), and understand if an identifier linking / federating task force is at the right point in time to setup.

### AOB

- Video of how to use SWH and biblatex together from Roberto [available](https://youtu.be/UhQCeAj9yKM)
- [LIBER2021](https://libereurope.eu/article/liber-2021-online-call-for-papers/) abstract on software citation and the role of research libraries submitted, led by Neil Chue Hong
  - if accepted, we would want to collect case studies from libraries
    - eg Morane mentioned HAL, Tom Morrell did something on this for Caltech Data in 2017 or so
  - maybe we should be doing this anyhow? (Neil will start doing this, using bibtex - others can add to it)
    - Martin suggests that https://zbib.org/ might be useful here
- Two citation initiatives relevant to us
  - [I4OC](https://i4oc.org/) (Open citations initiative) - close to 90% of citations (see https://i4oc.org/#publishers) are now open 
  - arXiv has joined DataCite and will start using DataCite DOIs (there was a PIDapolooza 2021 talk about this), and DataCite is also working with them to help them increase their use of data and software citations
