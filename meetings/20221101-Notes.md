### Call Logistics

- Possible future topics / People to invite on calls

  - Indexing
  - CHAOSS - how does citation fit in with other metrics? Matt Germonprez or Sean Goggins
  - New CFF schema
  - Measuring uptake (get a speaker who has experience of doing something similar?)
    - maybe do this a couple of times - soon and in a while
    - could we learn from someone working in data citation?

- Chair Rota (also responsibility for sending reminders and inviting speakers):
  - Tuesday, November 1 (Dan)
  - Thursday, December 1 (Neil to ask Martin if he can chair)
  - Tuesday, January 3 (Martin or Neil? - our feeling is to stick with this date due to conflicts on the 10th)
 
- Previous general structure of calls
  - Invited speaker on related topic (30 mins)
  - Updates from task forces (15 mins)
  - AOB (10 mins)
