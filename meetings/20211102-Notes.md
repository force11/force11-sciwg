### Call logistics

- Calls normally take place on the first Tuesday of every month at 3 PM CET / CEST.
- Notes will be published at: https://github.com/force11/force11-sciwg/tree/master/meetings
- We use Zoom: the link and password is sent to the mailing list in monthly reminders
- You can also dial in using your phone. Access Code also sent in monthly reminders
- Participants can raise things that they are working on / want to bring peoples attention to by [opening a GitHub issue](https://github.com/force11/force11-sciwg/issues). The co-chairs will curate and tag these issues as required, and maintain a document linking to them to summarise current status.
