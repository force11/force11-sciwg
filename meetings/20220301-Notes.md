## Agenda and Notes
Welcome to Natalie who is joining the call for the first time!

### Institutions task force

- Dan summarised the discussion that took place at the last meeting, but noted that there wasn't sufficient volunteer effort on the call to take it forward. This is both a lack of effort from people currently within the WG, as well as having people at the right level to champion it engaging in the WG.
- There was discussion of the path forward for this work - we could either identify a sensible next step to try and make the path clearer, or we could write up our thoughts and then park for now. Shelley gave an example from the geosciences of work done with AAU and APLU, and noted that the US National Academies were doing work with the various disciplinary/professional societies as an example of getting the message heard in institutions.
- There was discussion of the role of libraries as a route to institutional policy, but it was noted that while this was an easier route to get support to champion changes in practice around citation, it wasn't clear what the costs of implementing change at an institutions would be. There may be some way of getting an understanding of these costs from a librarians perspective through the RDA libraries community, LIBER, etc. Library policy is not the same as institutional policy in many cases, however - there's still something to be done to convince provosts 
- The agreement on the call was to try and write up the knowledge that had been collected so far into two blog posts for different audiences: 
   - Research software community (cross-post to ReSA, SSI, BSSw)
   - Institutional Consortia (AAU, APLU, European University Association, League of European Research Universities, etc)

ACTION: Discuss plan for writing Institutions blog posts at May 2022 meeting
