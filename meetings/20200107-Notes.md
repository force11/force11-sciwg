 - Participants can raise things that they are working on / want to bring peoples attention to by [opening a GitHub issue](https://github.com/force11/force11-sciwg/issues). The co-chairs will curate and tag these issues as required, and maintain a document linking to them to summarise current status.

### Actions

Standing:
 * ACTION: Someone to send out reminders of these calls & someone to take notes during these calls - rotating between Dan, Neil, Martin
 * ACTION: All to open issues in GitHub to disseminate things they're working on
 * ACTION: Neil: regular Guidance Taskforce calls continue
 * ACTION: Alice: regular Repository Best Practice Taskforce calls continue - contact Alice to join

One off:
 * ACTION: Dan to send details of first Publishers Task Force call to Arfon
 * ACTION: Discussion on whether we should refactor the various calls, and interaction between different WGs, IGs, and taskforces in this area to be put on agenda for future call.

## Agenda and Notes

_About half way through this call, we realised that at the last call in December it was agreed to postpone the date of the call a week - therefore this was a short call and a full call will take place next week_


### RDA/FORCE11 Software Source Code Identification WG (Dan)
- On creation was officially listed by RDA, but not by FORCE11.
- This was due to an administrative oversight - it was voted to be accepted but not formally listed - this is now fixed
- Chairs: Roberto, Martin, Dan

Neil noted that many of the things which were coming up in the various software-related RDA and FORCE11 groups were not strictly speaking software citation, but intersected. The scope of a Software Citation _Implementation_ Working Group could be broader than just software citation to cover other things which were required to enable the implementaiton of the software citation guidelines, but it might be good to review and potentially refactor the various calls and interactions in this space. It was proposed to have a discussion on a future call about whether there should be a "coordinating community call" that spans the work of the different groups in this area (perhaps this call, with revised scope).

### Update on RDA Plenary Melbourne (Dan/Neil) 
- The submissions for session proposals from the Software Source Identification WG (covering the different identifier schemes and the pros and cons of each) and Software Source Code IG (covering FAIR for software, and seeing how future stewardship of this would be done) were both accepted. 
- A BoF on Notebooks was also accepted, including archiving and citation of Notebooks, which may be relevant to this group.


### Update from task forces

- Guidance (Neil)
  - Drafts published on Zenodo and circulated.
  - Infrastructure to get formal feedback not setup yet.
  - Convene calls to review feedback and revise guidance

- Publishers (Dan)
  - First call this Friday 15:00 UTC, then recurring at same time on second Friday of each month
  - Question about whether proposed Software Peer Review guidance is in scope for this.

- Repositories (Dan on behalf of Alice)
  - (Copied from last month's minutes) 
    - Workshop info at https://github.com/ASCLnet/SWRegistryWorkshop. 
    - Good enough software citation workflow. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RAuZcZiOMS7iddhdzphmKhs3vZTcbe2Bicz_cUT7CGs/edit?usp=sharing. 
    - Value statement: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gJbmpR1HbAAKB5YLaGYHcaFIwN3IGGayyPGCKeQIxCU/edit?usp=sharing. 
    - More work is needed aligning codemeta and CFF metadata formats. Proposal: Codemeta as the exchange of metadata between repositories, and CFF should be translatable to codemeta when authors use it. 
    - Repositories Task Force will soon wrap its work on best practices. People from workshop want to continue to meet.
  - Scope of this task force is broader than just software citation - see earlier point on discussing whether we should have a coordinating community call across the broader software citation, publishing and archiving landscape

- Codemeta task force 
  - To be reported on January 14.
  
#### General logistics

- Next monthly Force11 Software Citation Implementation WG call will be on January 14 at 15:00 Berlin time
