## Agenda and Notes

### Enhanced citation support by GitHub announced

GitHub citation support via Citation File Format (CFF) announced last week via blog https://github.blog/changelog/2021-07-29-enhanced-citation-support/ and Twitter https://twitter.com/natfriedman/status/1420122675813441540.
Stephan Druskat gives an overview over CFF, and the work with GitHub and Rob Haines, using the Ruby-CFF gem.
The Working Group decides to write a blog post in August, as this is highly revelant for software citation implementation. Please reach out to Martin if you want to help with the blog post.

### Starting an Institutions Task Force in the working group

Neil: prework needed. In the call we briefly talked about potential candidates for the Task Force. The focus would be on institutional policies. See [notes from previous meeting](https://github.com/force11/force11-sciwg/blob/master/meetings/20210706-Notes.md#institutions-task-force-) for some details and ideas. Please reach out to the co-chairs Neil, Dan or Martin if you are interested. We will continue this discussion in the September monthly call.

### Updates from Task Forces

- Meeting notes Journals Task Force from July 6 at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zpSQ5e7e6udJsJuEKixQY8n2g--3HEKkatUz9Xz4Q5M/edit
- Registries Task Force is in the process of starting a new community of practice.
