## Notes from Telcon on 11 January 2022

Notes from [previous calls](#previous-calls) are now after the current meeting notes.

### Call logistics

- Calls normally take place on the first Tuesday of every month at 3 PM CET / CEST.
- Notes will be published at: https://github.com/force11/force11-sciwg/tree/master/meetings
- We use Zoom: the link and password is sent to the mailing list in monthly reminders
- You can also dial in using your phone. Access Code also sent in monthly reminders
- Participants can raise things that they are working on / want to bring peoples attention to by [opening a GitHub issue](https://github.com/force11/force11-sciwg/issues). The co-chairs will curate and tag these issues as required, and maintain a document linking to them to summarise current status.

## Agenda and Notes

- Daina gave an update on planned Software Citation workshop. Daina's institution (Harvard University) imposed new restrictions on in-person workshops because of the Omicron COVID variant. Her hope is that this should not restrict a workshop in early summer, e.g. in May.

- Martin raised the topic of adding CFF support to GitLab. Stephan and Martin used the FORCE2021 hackathon to explore what it would take to do that work, and how much this can be done by the community vs. GitLab staff. There is a strong sense in today's call that this is worth persuing further, but that it would need a champion to push this further.

- Neil talked about the experience at the FORCE2021 hackathon, and the parallel workshop about running a hackathon he attended. One observation is that the software citation hackathon was maybe less focussed than some of the other hackathons he recently participated in.

- One important topic is the releationship between CFF and CodeMeta, and possibly other metadata standards. Related, how to make a decision about what should go into the next major version of CodeMeta, as the FORCE11 Task Force does not feel comfortable making a final decision on this.

- Neil and Dan will start the planning for a possible Institutions task force in January, and this will be a main topic for next month's call.

- Next monthly call is February 1, with Dan as moderator.
