 - You can also dial in using your phone. Access Code: 826 409 840 - see bottom of this document for telephone numbers
 - Participants can raise things that they are working on / want to bring peoples attention to by [opening a GitHub issue](https://github.com/force11/force11-sciwg/issues). The co-chairs will curate and tag these issues as required, and maintain a document linking to them to summarise current status.

### Attending

- Daniel S. Katz
- Martin Fenner
- 
- 

### Apologies
- Shelley Stall
- 
 
### Actions

Standing:
 * ACTION: Someone to send out reminders of these calls & someone to take notes during these calls - rotating between Dan, Neil, Martin
 * ACTION: All to open issues in GitHub to disseminate things they're working on

## Agenda and Notes
  
### Talk
   - Martin Fenner: "DataCite Commons: A new service for discovering software and software citations" ([slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wrJuX5zOeUhX69N6KR2QyFINudEIXXJVF8gCFLfC20I/edit?usp=sharing))

#### Journals Task Force (Dan/Shelley)
   - [Minutes from September meeting of task force](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12i32BslsYfmPkTEID1U49TRr7BN4nKfuYnMY7Vj5F5k/edit)
   - Software Citation Primer submitted to F1000Research
      - Shelley leading effort to publicize
   - Task force is now working on improving the way that metadata is being collected and passed between systems in the scholarly publishing pipelines. 
      - Good talk about CrossRef schema changes, and how this affects software last month
   
#### Repositories Task Force (Alice)
   - 
   
#### CodeMeta task force (Martin)
   - 

#### Software Source Code Identification WG (Morane)
   - if there's news to share

### AOB

#### Discussion on purpose of this call, and potential topics / speakers to invite.

   - The main purpose of this call is to bring the community who are interested in software citation and related topics up-to-speed with what is happening in this area
      - The "call for lurkers"!
   - It's also useful to get in speakers on topics that can either help give a different perspective / insight on the work we're doing, or to introduce an area, project or initiative that we think will be useful for the software citation community to know about
   - Potential topics suggested were:
      - Linking, indexing and machine readable credit:
         - Overview of Scholix (Martin Fenner?)
         - Alt-metrics / Impact Indexes (Stefanie Haustein?)
         - How do we handle aggregation of versions / dependencies in giving credit for software citations?
         - Overview of [Ascepias](https://asclepias-broker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) work looking at Zenodo / NASA ADS / AAS (Alexandros Ioannidis /   Jose Benito Gonzalez Lopez / August Muench?)
         - Overview of how PubMedCentral deal with identifiers
      - Topics related to challenges paper:
         - Update on IMLS funded activity (Daina Bouquin)
         - How do we get authors to record and supply metadata (potentially a speaker from a software catalogue?)
         - Sociological frictions and how we understand and overcome them (potentially a social sciences expert working in this area?)
      - Topics related to development of software platforms that paper authors are using to help software citation (rather than the research software they're developing themselves)
         - Overview of JOSS / OJ underlying software (Arfon Smith?)
         - Overview of how different journal systems (e.g. OJS, PubSweet) handle software objects and metadata
         - How might code repositories support software citation / make it easier?
      - RSEs as a means to work with developers who need to get credit for the research software they're developing
      - How software citation affects / enables Reusability (as opposed to just Findability and Accessibility)
      - Access to software - distribution and publishing platforms, and how these relate to software citation
      
As part of this discussion, we noted that an issue is that the model for citations is different from the way that software is developed, and may not be as compatible as with datasets. Are there other research objects that are more like software than data? E.g. websites, specimen collections.

### Call Logistics

- Possible future topics / People to invite on calls
   - CHAOSS - how does citation fit in with other metrics? Matt Germonprez or Sean Goggins
   - New CFF schema
   - Measuring uptake (get a speaker who has experience of doing something similar?)
     - maybe do this a couple of times - soon and in a while
     - could we learn from someone working in data citation?
     - Martin to talk about Make Data Count Sloan project starting in August

- Chair Rota (also responsibility for sending reminders and inviting speakers):
   - Nov 3, 2020: Martin?
   - Dec 1, 2020: Neil?
   - Jan 5, 2020: Dan? (or delay a week?)
   
- Proposed structure of calls
   - Invited speaker on related topic (30 mins)
   - Updates from task forces (15 mins)
   - AOB (10 mins)
